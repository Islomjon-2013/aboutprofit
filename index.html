        Muhammad was the prophet and founder of Islam. Most of his early life
        was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from
        Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam.
        By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of
        2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess,
        “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.”Muhammad was
        born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). His father died
        before he was born and he was raised first by his grandfather and then
        his uncle. He belonged to a poor but respectable family of the Quraysh
        tribe. The family was active in Meccan politics and trade.
